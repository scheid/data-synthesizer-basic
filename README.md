## Data Synthesizer Basic

Non-Angular Implementation of the data synthesizer

This library is identical in function to the [https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-synthesizer](data synthesizer service for Angular), but with all Angular
dependencies removed. It is a plain Javascript implementation, easily used in React, Vue, etc.

For documentation on how to use the data synthesizer, see the read me of the data synthesizer service for Angular.

Also, for a working example, get the [React demo for the data synthesizer basic](https://github.com/scheid/data-synthesizer-basic-react-demo).
